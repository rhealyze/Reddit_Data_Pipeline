She was ultimately let go when a Christian extremist group filed a complaint to the library after Moore approved the display of a children’s book about a transgender boy.

According to Moore, the display (entitled “Color Our World”) included the book When Aidan Became a Brother (by trans male author Kyle Lukoff), a story about a family accepting a trans child named Aiden while also preparing for the birth of Aiden’s sibling. Library volunteers created the display as a part of a regional-wide summer theme featuring books that celebrate diversity.

“I simply supported community involvement, just as I have for other volunteer-led displays. That’s what librarians do — we create space for everybody… I did not tell the parents and children what they could or could not add to the display, just as I do not tell them what they can or cannot read,” she wrote in a statement."

Siding with tech companies on a pivotal question for the AI industry, U.S. District Judge William Alsup said Anthropic made ""fair use"" of books by writers Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson to train its Claude large language model.

Alsup also said, however, that Anthropic's copying and storage of more than 7 million pirated books in a ""central library"" infringed the authors' copyrights and was not fair use. The judge has ordered a trial in December to determine how much Anthropic owes for the infringement."
1lj7nrj,What are your biggest *put a book down* hatreds.,796,1005,Quebber,2025-06-24 10:35:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1lj7nrj/what_are_your_biggest_put_a_book_down_hatreds/,0.86,False,False,False,False,"For me it's two different one eldritch horror books or science fiction books where the enemy, this horror or alien race is suddenly understood and beaten by us humans, where instead of having this unknowable enemy or threat destroying our entire existence and we are barely hanging on, some child, dog or human with a macbook will come along and kick ass, oh and we have to have it from the bad guys point of view at some point so we lowly human readers can understand the angst in the heart of Cthulhu.

The second one for me is when you read the above book/series full of promise and build up and then the biggest enemies become other groups of humans, I know I get it humans suck but damn I wanted monsters and mayhem not another case of ""shadowy organisation number 9945 hunting down the hero or heroine because she will mess up there deal with the old ones who will always betray them and kill them off in the last scene""

Update: This is an awesome discussion, so good to see all the different things that take us out of a book or spoil our immersion, I didn't realise how many of these different things actually do bother me and take away from story and character believability.

Update 2: Stories matter, I am no longer able to read books, instead I listen to audio/audible books all the time, it kind of helps my brain settle (Autistic, bipolar, ADHD) helps me to function around the house, a good story can draw us in. Hope you are all having a splendiferous day. Hugs!."
1lj4uu2,catch-22 is devastating,179,42,pipesnbam,2025-06-24 07:33:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1lj4uu2/catch22_is_devastating/,0.94,False,False,False,False,"yes, yes, it is funny (certainly the first time through), but having just finished it, i think the flashes of grief that permeate the later half will stick with me longer. one that’s been lingering for me is directly after the Nately incident when the chaplain sees Yossarians face and tries to get to him. 

the brusque, unfinished nature of those scenes of loss is so penetrating- trying to describe something horrible that has happened and you lose your words mid sentence. 

like good lord, when he’s waiting for orr to come back after having needled him so much… it’s one of the few times yossarian seems content, warming the tent and waiting for his friend with his tales of raw cod. 

and juxtaposing those short, wrenching scenes against long winded ridiculous inane meanderings is remarkably effective. and very alike to what the real experience was, i have no doubt.   "

There were moments at the beginning where I thought the book was thicker than it needed to be but the farther I got into and at the moment I finished it, not a single line of this book was a chore to get through, except a certain memoir but that's too be expected.  This book packs quite a few gut punches in it without feeling too overwhelming or contrived in itself, you can understand each characters motivations and realize the biggest antagonist in this book is a lack of understanding between everyone.  I don't want to spoil anything because it was a fantastic book, and especially considering the current world events, I feel like I read this book at the right time.  "
1ljasro,"Why do so many books feel ""empty"", even if they are well written?",95,80,DieBlackfisk,2025-06-24 13:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ljasro/why_do_so_many_books_feel_empty_even_if_they_are/,0.79,False,False,False,False,"Sometimes, well writen books feel like a house with many long hallways and different people. They are characters that speak by themselves and have a 3D shape, with their own opinion and a strong personality. The hallways twist and turn in unexpected ways. There are random, unrecognizable smells, sounds and emotions. Voices echoing down the stairs, doors that lead to strange places and unrecognizable shapes in the shadows of the corners that make you feel a certain way. And sometimes you cannot find the way out, and even when you finish the book you keep ""trapped"" inside this house, trying to figure things out. Trying to understand where all the hallways lead to and if there is an undiscovered perspective in a character you hadn't discovered. 

Other times, books that seem just as well writen, feel like a well-built house, but all the doors are just shallow closets that lead nowhere. No matter all the doors you open, there is nothing of interest. Sometimes there is not even a door, it's just a drawing on the wall in a very long hallway that connects one point to another. And the characters are just cardboard cutouts, where you can see the author pulling the strings behind the curtains and speaking for them. And the walls are made of paper, everything is unmovable and static. The ways that the characters talk, think and act are scripted, as if there was one gigant dialogue box in the ceiling everyone could read. However, aparently there is nothing wrong.

This has happened to me in a few occasions, and I cannot understand why does this happen. I won't name books so avoid fingerpointing, but if you get where I am coming from, then you probably can think of some examples.

And no, it's not about books from before vs. modern books. It happened to me when reading books from different times.

If you got this feeling as well, did you understand why this happens? I know it relates to the ability of the writer, but how?"

I liked:

- Holly as a character. Have read different takes on her, but I actually like the way she's portrayed and her character arc from timid wallflower to self-governed individual.

- After a slow start (imo) the story picks up pace from the middle to end and you want to know what's going to happen.

- Ending is like a nod to horror, like King going, ya this wasn't a horror novel at all but that's still my genre. I kinda liked that.

I disliked:

- Probably the slowest King novel ever for me to get into. Start of the story was a drag for me.

- Probably controversial, but repeated use of carbon copy ""good characters"". I do not, repeat, DO NOT want to start any political discussion and don't give a shit who's left, right, progressive, conservative or whatever. But all the ""good characters"" very clearly fall into one category. On the other hand, there are no carbon copy ""evil people"" of the other category, so there's that. Still, the world and human beings ain't that binary.

- You'll need a lot of suspension of disbelief. I don't want to spoiler, but several constellations in this novel are so unlikely they seem heavily construed. From the sports event, to which characters end up together in the final scene, I don't know ... the suspense carries you over the unrealistic plot parts, especially in the last third of the book, so it's still entertaining though.

Those are my thoughts off the top of my head.

1ljsxej,On Thomas Pynchon’s V.,8,2,Significant_Try_6067,2025-06-25 01:27:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ljsxej/on_thomas_pynchons_v/,0.79,False,False,True,False,"Just finished V. And wow. I felt I had to share some of my thoughts on it. First, the novel seems to portray the presence of fate as one of decay, which is the only constant. Divine intervention in the novel is displayed as ordaining to a system incomprehensible to the very nature of the human mind, and existence. Shelly Stencil fears the inanimate originally in the form of cars, yet soon acclimates to it and is lost to V. As we're Melaine, Godolphib, and Herbert. V. Is the unknown constant that is ever-present, and to me portrayed the destroyer of those who come to value the comfort of the inanimate over reality. This could elude to the increasing reliance in technology. Entropy is impossible to harness for its system is divine, Shelly's death is but one of a man who came to find life in the inanimate, and in doing so doomed himself before the threshold of divine entropy. In my mind V. Is a cautionary novel, one warning against the finding of meaning in the inanimate, until all that is left is an unwavering faith in the objectivity imagined by this choice."

Unable to crack any job interviews, Shom goes about trying his hand in business.

A harmless, innocent middle class guy from a well to do family to a ruthless and selfish business man of this new age Kolkata who lust for money and fame in this deranged society. Like Shom you feel helpless at the passage of time...how times have changed you into something you've despised all your life... a vicious predator in the concrete jungles of Kolkata. The poet Shom described just this sort of animal in his poem as the predators in this concrete jungle who prey on the innocent and gullible... unbeknownst to him, that someday he will be the predator hauting the same jungle.

Sankar tells a timeless story through his prose...one that reads like a poem with all the poetic nuances but describes the brutal and barbaric breakdown of a once innocent soul.
Maybe in one way or other we all end up like Shom. People end up becoming their worst nightmares.

PS: Satyajit Ray made a movie on this novel...which is equally enthralling. Do check it out."
1ljp9hz,"Calico Palace, by Gwen Bristow A Satisfying Historical Novel",2,2,punabear,2025-06-24 22:38:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ljp9hz/calico_palace_by_gwen_bristow_a_satisfying/,0.67,False,False,False,False,"     This book was a nice surprise. I’ve always enjoyed the history of the California gold rush but most stories are about the gold seekers that got there too late and didn’t hit their jackpots. This story begins in San Francisco in 1848, population 900. Rumors of gold discoveries in the hills came down to the city but by and large most residents were doubtful. Slowly, the curious ones trekked up to Sutters Mill to see if the rumors were true. Thus began the rush that eventually deposited 750,000 pounds of gold into Americas coffers. This book is  about the winners that hit the Mother Lode early. 
	This book is a good story. The writing is fine. The author isn’t going to get any Pulitzer Prize for this but the story itself is the book. It is actually a story about San Francisco as much as the Mother Lode. I learned a lot about the early days of the city and the resilience of motivated humans. It’s a love story too. I almost put the book down in the beginning because I couldn’t care less about Ted and Kendra’s relationship and I was afraid it was going to turn into a sappy romance novel. It didn’t. The relationships that developed were, by and large, integral to the story. The characters were well developed and memorable. The women were too pragmatic to waste their time on man problems. The main crackers, Kendra and Marny, understood their priorities and they proved to be strong, independent women. 
	You won’t be disappointed. "
1ljwzmk,"Beyond the city and into the stars: Arthur C. Clarke's ""The City and the Stars"".",1,0,i-the-muso-1968,2025-06-25 05:01:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ljwzmk/beyond_the_city_and_into_the_stars_arthur_c/,1.0,False,False,False,False,"Quickly just wrapped up reading Arthur C. Clarke's ""The City and the Stars"" for tonight, and it was pretty delightful!

Men had built cities before, but the city of Diaspar is definitely unlike anything that has come before it. For millennia the city's dome has protected it from the dangers of the outside and the decay that follows it.

At one time it had powers that ruled the stars, but one day, according to legend, the invaders had come and had driven man into the very city that has now become its refuge.

But now comes a man, and a very unique, who will break Diaspar's complete and stifling inertia, destroy the legend and find out the true origins of the invaders.

So this is one of Clarke's stand alone novels. The one thing I've come to appreciate about him ever since I've read his Odyssey, is the sense of wonder that he brings to his works. And that I got plenty of that in ""The City and the Stars"", and also some introspection and adventure.

Even more interesting to me (though it's very much common knowledge nowadays) that this is a revised and expanded version of his first novel ""Against The Fall of Night"". Now I have yet to get on my hands on a copy of that particular version of the story, but maybe I will, if only to compare the differences with it and the current version.

Any who, it's great to read some more Arthur C. Clarke, and in the future hope to read more. Maybe a few more of his stand alones, some short story collections or another of his novel series. Whatever the case I still have more books to read as of right now, but eventually I'll get to some more sometime soon!"
