1lic1ne,This is unacceptable (AI in Literature),4472,457,hostile_scrotum,2025-06-23 09:20:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1lic1ne/this_is_unacceptable_ai_in_literature/,0.94,False,False,False,False,"https://imgur.com/a/akvfUQD

I found this Author called Sophia Blackwell. She released some books in the past (I think 2008 and 2012) and the bibliography was very small. But now between Mai and June of this year she released countless books on philosophy. I skimmed through some of them and all of them reek of AI.

I hate this development, because at some point I will be forced to read books written pre AI when I want to be sure that it’s written by a human."
1limt1v,A decade of book collecting and how my opinion has changed,450,99,Embarrassed_Bee_5623,2025-06-23 17:30:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1limt1v/a_decade_of_book_collecting_and_how_my_opinion/,0.96,False,False,False,False,"I've always been a book lover and an avid reader. There were always books on my house growing up. I didn't start strongly collecting and developing a personal library until I started working at a book store in college 10 years ago. In the past 10 years how I view and collect books has changed so much. 

When I started working at a bookstore I started to feel the urge to own every book I ever read and to have a large owned TBR pile. I dreamed of having huge shelves full of books and having my own personal library. 

Between my husband and I over a few years we accumulated hundreds of books through work, the used book store, thrift stores, etc. We read a lot of them too, but realistically, we were never going to read all these books, even if that was our intention. 

We eventually bought a house and I had space for the library of my dreams. We had it all set up and cozy, but it turns out, we never used the space. We prefer to either read in the living room or in bed. Eventually, I moved a lot of the books out to the living room so I could at least look at them. 

Over the next few years I started losing interest in buying books and during COVID I actually stopped reading. I went from 50+ books a year to 12. Eventually as things got back to normalt love for reading came back. I culled my TBR to about 50 books and spent a year reading through them. 

Now I have 3 books left of my physical TBR and it feels great. I've been using the library so much more and I've also really been loving my reader. I just went through my shelves today and have about 45 books I plan on donating. These are all books I had planned on keeping because I rated them highly, but it occurred to me today I'm never going to re-read them so why keep them. 

I'm much more content today utilizing my library and only buying books sparingly. I don't feel overwhelmed by my unread books, and I don't feel like I'm missing out by not buying books. I love that I can save space with having books on my e-reader. 

I still love books and I love reading, I just no longer want my home to be filled with hundreds of books I've never read, or will never re-read. "

I'm 3 chapters in. Fuck the Reeds! This poor girl. From cultural osmosis, with the reverence I know some people give this book, I thought this was gonna be a quaint, sweet old timey romp when she got in the window seat with her bird book, described all cozy, but NOPE. Abuse immediately.

I'm going to read 8 chapters and talk about it on Saturday. I was worried I'd struggle with this, but I am invested."
1lim8y9,One reader's opinion of The Brother's Karamazov,11,30,S_B_L,2025-06-23 17:09:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1lim8y9/one_readers_opinion_of_the_brothers_karamazov/,0.64,False,False,True,False,"Over the years, I've found a lot of TV to be similar, or predictable, so I transitioned over to books. I love it. I read daily - sometimes a lot, sometimes a little. I appreciate both fiction and non-fiction, but recently, I've been all-in on fiction. Probably once a year, maybe from these communities on reddit, or from youtubers or whatever, I get this itch. You probably know it - the one that pushes you to pick-up a classic book and... I don't know... prove to yourself you're a *real* reader, not just a beach reader. Maybe you don't get that feeling. I've accepted it. That's some context for why I picked up The Brother's Karamazov.

The last time I scratched this itch was with East of Eden, which was *unbelievable*. Unlike a lot of the criticisms about TBK, I had no trouble keeping up with this book. The hype intimidated me, everyone saying how dense it was an whatnot. It was dense, sure (I read Ivan's poem twice after restarting in the middle once), but it all held my interest. I read it in four weeks. My first Dostoevsky and..... (spoilers below)

  
I liked it. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was good. I feel weird criticizing one of the most celebrated books ever, but for the sake of discussion, I can't help but think it was too ambitious. That it read like two big ideas smashed together. The stronger of which, in my opinion, was the murder and trial, but that could've been written in 300-400 pages. There was so much on Zosima and Alyosha, all of this God vs No God discussion and symbolism. Alyosha's purity, especially after he kisses Ivan, what he represents and his interactions symbolic and heavily present in the first half of the novel. Ivan's stance on it - his poem, his intensity - reduced more to his actions as soon as the murder happened. All of that meaning and momentum, while there, downsized tremendously. The tone shifted. I found myself wondering if this book was started as a way to compare purity, evil, love, religion between three brothers and their complicated father, but then hit a roadblock, and pivoted to a court room drama. 

Yes, this is big and philosophical and has some really neat ideas. I am certainly not mad I read it. I generally liked it. Would I go out of my way to recommend it, especially to someone who's not seeking out older, ambitious work? No. Would I recommend it to people who are? Sure. But I just can't shake this feeling that there were a lot of chapters just for the sake of... I don't know... personal commentary? Philosophy? I don't want to rub anyone the wrong way by saying this, just my opinion. Curious to hear if others felt similarly, or if different, why?"
